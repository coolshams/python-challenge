### General
PyBank & PyPoll have Analysis & Resources folders. Resources folders have the input data sets & analysis folders have the output text files.
main.py contain the code.

#### PyBank Overview
Approached this using single for loop. The calculations/equations were straight forward on this one.Some key takeaways:
1. os.path.join for appropriate file paths. Explored/read a bit on this.
2. Use of split function to "visualize" the csv file contents as "two columns".
3. Printing an output text file!

#### PyPoll Overview
This one was a little bit tricky with a larger data set & use of dictionaries. Some key takeaways:
1. Dictionaries & using them in if statement - to get the keys & values - referenced recordings as well google on this! 
2. Use of strip function to eliminate unwated characters/spaces.

#### Conclusion
Getting familiar with VS code & concept dictionary, revisiting recordings and some serious googling helped me with this one!
